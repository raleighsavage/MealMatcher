# MealMatcher - Intelligent Restaurant Discoverer

## Basic Description, TLDR:

**Meal Matcher** works by, firstly, taking in information about restaurants. This information includes:
- The restaurant's name
- The type of cuisine that restaurant serves
- The average price of a meal
- When they're open and closed

It then stores that information in a text file and draws upon that information to help you decide where to eat based on what kind(s) of cuisine sound good to you and how much you're willing to spend. I've provided some of my personal favorites in my area, but try adding your own!

*Note that you will need to change the file path for MealMatcher to work on your machine*

### Inspiration

When meeting with friends, going out with family, or when planning a date, no question haunts me quite like the question: "Where do you want to eat?". When I hear that my brain just completely shuts down and I somehow just lose all memory of the restaurants I enjoy. However a strategy I learned to help with the decision process is asking certain questions like  "what style of food sounds good to you" and "how much are you willing to spend today" in order to narrow down the options. The only problem with that is I can't remember the hundreds of restaurants in my university town off hand. That's when I got the idea to make a program that could add and store as many restaurants as I wanted along with all their information. This accompanied by a function that could go through the decision process by only selecting restaurants that meet certain criteria (open, cuisine type, price) and having the option to select from that narrowed list at random. I've used this program a few times and allowed a few others to try it and have experienced only positive results so far.
