# MealMatcher - Intelligent Restaurant Discoverer

## Basic Description, TLDR:

**Meal Matcher** works by taking in information about restaurants, including:
- The restaurant's name
- The type of cuisine that restaurant serves
- The average price of a meal
- When they're open and closed
It then stores that information in a text file and uses that information to help you decide where to eat based on what kind(s) of cuisine sound good to you and how much you're willing to spend. I've provided some of my personal favorites in my area, but try adding your own!

*Note that you will need to change the file path for MealMatcher to work on your machine*
